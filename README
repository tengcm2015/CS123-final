CS123 Final Project: Bouncing balls in a Tilted Box

Theme:

We simulate balls bouncing in a box. User can add balls and drag the box to create
motions by changing gravity as well as enable raymarching, fxaa and balls-to-balls
collision features.

Features:
- Balls collision simulation
- GPU Ray marching
- Fast anti-aliasing filter
- Bump mapping for texture

Design Architecture:
We reused the code from Shape project to create balls and box, Sceneview project to
handle camera view, Lab 10 Shadertoy as a framework for raytracing and tutorial on
FXAA by simonrodriguez.
We separate the physics simulation task from ray marching task so that each feature
is independent from each other for easier development.
There's a Physics Data class dedicated to storing the input parameters from users and
saved in each ball object.
Phong shaders share the same data structure of Scene class so that modifications
in Scene class can be applied directly to both raymarching and phong shaders.

At the current state, we couldn't find a way to enable multiple textures in a single 
shader program, so only one texture can be activated at the same time for one shader program.
